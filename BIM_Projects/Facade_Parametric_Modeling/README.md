# 🧱 Automated Facade Production Modeling

This project focuses on the creation of detailed production models for facade elements of a complex architectural structure.

---

## 🧩 Main Challenge

The architectural design featured **non-repetitive, angular facade geometry**, which made manual modeling of individual profiles and connections inefficient and error-prone.

---

## ⚙️ Solution

To address this, I developed a **Grasshopper definition** that automates the generation of:
- 3D facade profiles
- Substructure geometries
- Connection details

The algorithm works by **selecting a surface** from the base facade model. It then:
1. Analyzes surface orientation and curvature
2. Aligns profile elements accordingly
3. Creates parametric extrusion and connection logic
4. Outputs geometry suitable for production and detailing in Rhino
